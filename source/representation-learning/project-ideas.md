- Neural-style for audio/video
- Word-embeddings /captioning --> image generation
- LSTM/recurrent networks for downsampling (would probably require a matrix/tensor approach)

# Networks on Networks

- Stepsize selection via an ancilliary network
- Regularization parameter selection via ancilliary network
- Choosing from among training images for adverserial examples
- Learning to prune (via ancilliary network)
- Networks that aim to minimize error over a window, with a DQN/bandit like approach
- 

# Adverserial

- An adverserial network, but also with a helper network
- Networks that detect image alteration, e.g. deep-dream/neural style
- Selecting from among a set of hidden, "natural" images for adverserial examples
- Learning whether an individual patch of an image is "natural" or not
